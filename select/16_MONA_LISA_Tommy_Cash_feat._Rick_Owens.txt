Haha-ha, haha-haha-ha-ha!
Hey, ah, ooh
Haha-ha, haha-haha-ha-ha!
Ya!

Slave with a golden chain, feel like Ukraine
Why my shoes cost 2K but I'm dancing in the rain?
Refugee at home, and a stranger on a plane
Dali and Picasso made in Spain, Tommy made in pain
My circle is so small I'm afraid to have fights
You don't have a gang, why you throwing gang signs?
I try to get fly times but my time flies fast
Never having time, ya, never a right time, huh
Fuck safe sex, I'll be dancing on landmines
I ain't got no master, just one mastermind
If you press play on this, it's a homicide
All the jokes aside, are you doing alright?
Will you ever die? I just fucking ride
Dirty, dirty drugs, I'm just doing Tide
Kill everyone, yeah, save the mankind
Met Mona Lisa on a bus line

Stoned all my life, stoned all my life like mannequin
If I got a problem, if I got a problem, roll it up
Stoned all my life, stoned all my life like mannequin
If I got a problem, then I roll it up
Stoned all my life, stoned all my life like mannequin
If I got a problem, if I got a problem, roll it up
Stoned all my life, stoned all my life like mannequin
If I got a problem, then I roll it up

On stage I make Renaissance (On stage I make Renaissance)

Black magic
Fuckboy teen
Tired, got her clean (Be at the ready for quarantine)
Guillotine flosses (Enough of that)

Come from small town with dreams too big
Child of Tarantino having sex with Kubrick
Bitch won't suck it, saying it's too big
Talking 'bout my ego, are you fucking stupid?
No neck to break but bread to make
Find me swimming in fire lake
Eenie, minie mo you're fake
Never sleep, always awake
I'm like yogi, meditate
Medicate and concentrate
Coming from the special aid
Pissing on the pearly gate

Fear and loathing we got mescaline
(We got mescaline, we got mescaline)
Run out of money now we eat sardines
(Then we eat sardines, no money)
Fooling around and let us buy ketamine
(Fooling around and let us buy ketamine)
Broccoli forever, we love collard greens, greens
(Broccoli forever, we love collard greens)

Necromantic savage
