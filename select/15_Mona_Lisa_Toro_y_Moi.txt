On the town, dropped it in the morning
I saw you dive into exactly who I think I am
Oh damn, I feel like I made this up
One man makin' choices for himself
Two shaken voices often tell a lie

Is there love?
Just a, just a livin'
She's a Mona Lisa girl
Diva, with him
She's the kind to lead you on

Why's a psycho on the roof again?
Skippin' therapy to make a friend
It's a hard day in the city
Don't let the heat make your decisions
You're losing wit, self-pity
Change it up for next season

There's another one for you
Oh there's another one for you

Is there love?
Just a, just a livin'
She's a Mona Lisa girl
Diva, with him
She's the kind to lead you on

There's another one for you
Oh there's another one for you
Oh, another for you
Another one for you

Another one for you and me too
