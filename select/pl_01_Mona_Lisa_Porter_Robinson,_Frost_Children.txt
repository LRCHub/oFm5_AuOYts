I, I, I
I like the way you look
around me
When the world's still,
I just don't care (Ah)
I love the way
you're not insulted
when everyone stares
I just don't care
Delicate is all you are
You're all I want to see
(I, I, I)
Mona Lisa, darling
You're still a starlet
Any minute I'll wait for you
And I least I saw it
Mona Lisa, darling
Any minute I'll wait for you
I, I, I
I like the way you do
your make-up
It's just so sweet,
I know you do it for me
And everybody else surrounds you
but you never leave
I know you wait for me
All in all, you're all I want
I want what's underneath
that heart
Mona Lisa, darling
You're still a starlet
Any minute I'll wait for you
And I least I saw it
Mona Lisa, darling
Any minute I'll wait for you
You
You
Anything is anything,
you're everything to me
'Cause I remember everything,
do you remember me?
Am I just one more face
to the door
What's it all for?
I'm taking you home
Too late, blood on my face
What can I say?
I'm taking you home
One more face to the door
What's it all for?
I'm taking you home
Too late, blood on my face
What can I say?
I'm taking you home
One more, one more fucking face
to the door (Mona Lisa, darling)
One more, one more fucking face
to the door (Mona Lisa, darling)
Woah, Mona Lisa, darling
You're still a starlet
Any minute I'll wait for you
