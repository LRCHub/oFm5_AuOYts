Mona Lisa smiles
Yes, I'm fluent in both tongues
She's got legs for miles
She could make it fun

She knows, she toys
It shows, oh boy

Moulabunda, she says
Will I try a little harder
She wants everything I got
She says she can almost taste it

She's that kind of girl
And she's knocking
Knocking down my front door
She could rock your world
Oh
She could take you down
Like never before

She knows, she toys
We're girls

In another life
Or maybe on another planet
We were loving life
We were lavender lovers
Yeah

She's that kind of girl
And she's knocking
Banging down my front door
She could rock your world
Oh
She could shake you down
Like never before

She knows, she toys
We're girls, oh boy

And she keeps coming back
And she keeps coming back for more
And she keeps calling me
And she keeps calling me for more
And she keeps coming back
And she keeps coming back for more
And Sappho's calling me
And Sappho screams to me
To come on
Come on, baby

Yeah
And she's knocking
Knocking down my front door
She could rock you
Oh
Shake it, shake, shake
Shake it some more

She's that kind of girl
Oh
And she's knocking
Kicking down my front door
She could
Oh
She could shake you down
And beg you for more

She knows, she toys
We're girls
Oh yeah
She knows, she toys
We're girls, oh boy
She knows, she toys
We're girls, oh boy
She knows, she toys
We're girls, oh boy
She knows, she toys
We're girls, oh boy
We're girls, we're girls
We're girls, we're girls
We're girls, we're girls
We're girls, we're girls.
