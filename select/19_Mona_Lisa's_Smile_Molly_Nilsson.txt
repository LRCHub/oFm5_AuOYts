Oh I know
While the masters are signing their names
We make the show
They pay us and leave with the fame
You put your pain into painting
You turn your sickness into music
Now people come from miles, to Mona Lisa's smile
One day we will be the greatest

(Forget the keyboard in the house)
Where i've been
They told me everything about me was a sin
But now i go
Where not even the meanest wind would wanna blow

Step into the night and let me turn off your light
Step into the ring but it's not you that i fight
I'm raising my fist for everyone who ever missed,
And never made it

One day we will be the Greatest
One day we will be the Greatest
One day we will be the Greatest
We will be the Greatest
